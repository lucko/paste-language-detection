# paste-language-detection

A tiny HTTP webservice which can detect the programming language used in a [paste](https://github.com/lucko/paste).

Uses the [VS Code language detection module](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languagedetection) which rather conveniently has been open sourced as a standalone project. :)
